# SDET-Test

The purpose of this project is to complete all tasks from the SDET-test challenge and to be able to test all requested scenarios.

Lets discuss the project with more depth:

JS, Node.js and React was my stack of choice for this challenge. This stack allowed me to display the photos on different components that
added detailed information for each picture. Also gives us a view that lets us compare the photos by looking at the results given by
NASA APIs, in order to comply with the first 3 tasks of this challenge. Test scenario 4 is validated using a unit test assertion
that sends an alarm message. src/data/getImages.js file has functionality comments on all methods and fuctions used for this challenge.

# What could be improved in this project?

- Hash API Key in order to improve security.
- Frontend could be optimized and refactored in order to display the photos with a more detailed view. 
- Warnings because of duplicated IDs when displaying pictures side by side (will be fixed in the next push).
- Always open to advice from colleagues so shoot away!
